## Core Components

### 1. Grid System
- Implements a flexible grid-based world
- Supports dynamic resizing
- Handles entity placement and movement
- Provides visualization with emoji-based representation

### 2. Entities

#### Hunters
- Specialized hunters with unique skills:
  - Navigation (ðŸ§­)
  - Stealth (ðŸ‘»)
  - Speed (âš¡)
  - Strength (ðŸ’ª)
- Stamina-based movement system
- Treasure collection capabilities

#### Knights
- Energy-based movement system
- Defensive role in the simulation
- Unique positioning and behavior patterns

#### Treasures
- Multiple types with varying values:
  - Bronze (ðŸ¥‰)
  - Silver (ðŸª™)
  - Gold (ðŸ‘‘)
  - Diamond (ðŸ’Ž)
- Value scaling based on grid size

#### Hideouts
- Safe zones for treasure storage
- Capacity-based storage system
- Strategic positioning elements

### 3. Game Mechanics

#### Movement System
- Grid-based movement (up, down, left, right)
- Stamina/energy management
- Collision detection
- Wrap-around grid boundaries

#### Treasure Collection
- Path finding to treasures
- Collection mechanics
- Value-based scoring system

#### Hunter Control
- Player-controlled hunter selection
- Skill-based advantages
- Status monitoring
